                Among the regions of Georgia, the weather and climate of Ajara are distinguished by different physical-geographical characteristics, which are expressed by a humid subtropical climate. Ajara's coastal beaches, swampy plains, water and forest resources, high mountains, and alpine meadows represent the region's diverse natural assemblage. Accordingly, the weather and climate of Ajara are different depending on the variety of its terrain.

Ajara region is a tourist destination with four seasons, therefore the climate changes dramatically in all four seasons. The region is mostly characterized by sub-tropical weather, with warm winters and hot summers, although torrential rain is a frequent visitor to Batumi. The Black Sea coast is more wetland than the mountainous regions of Ajara, which are characterized by a lack of snow, although it rarely snows in Batumi and the snow melts soon.

The climate of the Ajara region is mainly characterized by two characteristics: humid subtropical and dry mountain climate. The coastal zone has a moderate and warm climate, where the average temperature during the year is 13-14.5 degrees, the average temperature in January is +6.5, and in August it is +24.5 degrees. Highland regions are characterized by a relatively cool and cold climate in the winter months, where the average temperature during the year is 2-4 degrees, +1 in January, and +19 degrees in July.

Considering that Ajara is a sub-tropical region, it often experiences rain and humidity. It is in Ajara that Europe's precipitation pole is located - Mount Mtirala, where up to 4000 mm of precipitation falls annually. The climate of Ajara is so unique that in one space, in the Batumi Botanical Garden, plant species from different climatic and landscape zones are gathered: East Asia and Himalayas, Australia and New Zealand, South and North America, Mexico, the Mediterranean, and Transcaucasia.

Ajara offers a variety of tourist adventures in all four seasons of the year, where you can enjoy the Black Sea coastline in the summer months, the national parks of the region in the spring and autumn, the dizzying variety of colors of nature, and one of the best ski resorts in the winter.
